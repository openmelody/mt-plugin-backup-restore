# Overview

This plugin is used to create full-fidelity backups of one or more blogs, and then to restore them locally or another installation. This is a great tool to provided added peace of mind to the security and integrity of your system should something go wrong, as well as being a great tool to help people move blogs from one system to another. 

## Prerequisites

This plugin requires Melody 1.1 (currently in development at the time this readme was written). This plugin will NOT work in MT4 as it requires a number of key enhancements to core Movable Type/Melody libraries that address character encoding.  

## Technical Background

In Movable Type and Melody 1.0 the backup and restore functionality is hard coded right into the core distribution. In an effort to improve the modularity of the core distribution, by moving the logic out of the core and into a plugin or addon.
